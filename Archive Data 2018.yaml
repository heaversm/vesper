classifiers:

    - name: MPG Ranch Outside Classifier 1.0
      description: >
          Classifies a clip as "Outside" if and only if its start time is
          outside of the interval from one hour after sunset to one half
          hour before sunrise.

    - name: MPG Ranch Coarse Classifier 1.0
      description: >
          Classifies a clip as "Call" or "Noise" if and only if it is not
          yet classified. The classifier is an SVM trained on MPG Ranch
          clips from 2012-2014. Different SVMs are used for clips detected
          by the Old Bird Tseep and Old Bird Thrush detectors.

    - name: MPG Ranch NFC Coarse Classifier 2.0
      description: >
          Classifies an unclassified clip as a "Call" if it appears to be
          a nocturnal flight call, or as a "Noise" otherwise. Does not
          classify a clip that has already been classified, whether
          manually or automatically.

    - name: MPG Ranch Species Classifier 1.0
      description: >
          Classifies some "Call" clips to species (more documentation needed).
